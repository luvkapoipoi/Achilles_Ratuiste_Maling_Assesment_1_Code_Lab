#                          Exercise 2:Simple Sums - 15 Marks
# In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, 
#                         and print the result to the console.

#        Steps:
#        1 Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
#        2 Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
#        3 Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#        4 Print the value of the sum to the console.

integer1 = 8
integer2 = 10

sum_result = (integer1 + integer2)

print(sum_result)

# Explanation: In this code, it emphasises integer1 as 8 and integer2 as 10. 
#              It then stores it in sum_result and calculates their sum, which is
#              printed to the terminal. Output will be 18

# Output = 18
