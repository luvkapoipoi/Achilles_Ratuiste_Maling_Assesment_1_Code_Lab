#                   Exercise 7: Some Counting - 20 Marks
# Use your newly acquired knowledge of the for loop to complete the following tasks. 
#                Print all values to the console in each case.

# - Write a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
# - Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
# - Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
# - Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
# - Write a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5. You may include all loops in a single project

# Program

# 0 to 50 in increments of 1
print("Starting to count up from 0 to 50... ")
for i in range(0, 51):
    print (i)

# 50 to 0 in decrements of 1
print("Starting to count down from 50 to 0...")
for i in range(51, 0):
    print (i)
